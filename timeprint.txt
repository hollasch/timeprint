                     [string] ... [string]

This command prints time information to the standard output stream. All string
fragments will be concatenated with a space, so it's often unnecessary to quote
the format string.

timeprint operates in either absolute or differential mode. If one time value
is specified, then values for that absolute time are reported. If two time
values are supplied, then timeprint reports the values for the positive
difference between those two values. If no time values are given, then --now
is implied.

Single-letter command options that take an argument may be specified with or
without token separation. (For example, both `-htimeSyntax` and `-h timeSyntax`
are valid.)

    --help [topic], -h[topic], /?
        Print help and usage information in general, or for the optional
        specified topic. Topics include 'full', 'examples', 'version',
        'delta'/'deltaTime'/'deltaTimes', 'format'/'formatCode'/'formatCodes',
        'timeSyntax', and 'timeZone'/'timeZones'.

    --version
        Print version information.

    --codeChar <char>, -%<char>
        The --codeChar switch specifies an alternate code character to the
        default '%' character. If the backslash (\) is specified as the code
        character, then normal backslash escapes will be disabled. The
        --codeChar switch is ignored unless the format string is specified on
        the command line.

    --timeZone <zone>, -z<zone>
        The --timeZone argument takes a timezone string of the form used by the
        TZ environment variable and displays the result in that time zone. If no
        timezone is specified, the value in the TZ environment variable is used.
        If the environment variable TZ is unset, the system local time is used.
        For a description of the time zone format, use `--help timeZone`.

    --now, -n
        Use the current time. This is useful when specifying one of two time
        values for delta time printing. For absolute time printing, `--now` is
        the default.

    --time <value>, -t<value>
        Specifies an explicit absolute time, using ISO 8601 syntax. For a
        description of supported syntax, use `--help timeSyntax`.

    --access|--accessed <fileName>, -a<fileName>
        Use the time of last access of the named file for a time value.

    --create|--created|--creation <fileName>, -c<fileName>
        Use the creation time of the named file.

    --modify|--modified|--modification <fileName>, -m<fileName>
        Use the modification time of the named file.

If no output string is supplied, the format specified in the environment
variable TIMEFORMAT is used. If this variable is not set, then the format
defaults to "%#c". The TIMEFORMAT string must use the "%" code character.

Similarly, the default difference time format may be specified with the
TIMEFORMAT_DELTA environment variable. If this variable is not set, then the
format defaults to "%_Y years, %_yD days, %_d0H:%_h0M:%_m0S". The
TIMEFORMAT_DELTA string must use the "%" code character.

Note that if your format string begins with - or /, you will need to prefix it
with a \ character so that it is not confused with a command switch.

Strings take both \-escaped characters and %-codes in the style of printf.
The escape codes include \n (newline), \t (tab), \b (backspace),
\r (carriage return), and \a (alert, or beep).

For a full description of supported time format codes, use
`--help format`.

For additional help, use `--help <topic>`, where <topic> is one of:
    - timeSyntax
    - timeZone / timeZones
    - format / formatCode / formatCodes
    - delta / deltaTime / deltaTimes

Time Syntax
------------
    The explicit `--time` option supports a variety of different formats,
    based on the ISO 8601 date/time format.

    An explicit date-time may have a date, a time, or both. In the case of
    both, they must be separated by the letter `T`. No spaces are allowed in
    the string.

    The date can take one of the following patterns, where a `=` character
    denotes a required dash, and a `-` denotes an optional dash:

        YYYY-MM-DD
        YYYY=MM
        YYYY
        ==MM-DD
        YYYY-DDD   (DDD = day of the year)

    The time can take one of the following patterns, where the `:` characters
    are optional:

        HH:MM:SS
        HH:MM
        HH

    The time may be followed by an optional time zone, which has the following
    pattern, where `+` represents a required `+` or `-` character.

        +HHMM    (Offset from UTC)
        +HH      (Offset from UTC)
        Z        (Zulu, or UTC)

    Parsing the explicit time value takes place as follows: if the string
    contains a `T`, then the date is parsed before the `T`, and the time is
    parsed after. If the string contains no `T`, then time parsing is first
    attempted, and on failure date parsing is attempted. Again, parsing is
    strict, and no other characters may included anywhere.

    Any unspecified units get the current time value for that unit.

    Example explicit time values include the following:

        2018-02-24T20:58:46-0800
        2018-02-25T04:58:46Z
        17:57
        --05-07
        120000Z
        1997-183
        19731217T113618-0700

    See `--help examples` for other examples.


Time Zones
-----------
    The time zone value may be specified with the TZ environment variable,
    or using the `--timezone` option. Time zones have the format
    `tzn[+|-]hh[:mm[:ss]][dzn]`, where

        tzn
            Time-zone name, three letters or more, such as PST.

        [+|-]hh
            The time that must be ADDED to local time to get UTC.
            CAREFUL: Unfortunately, this value is negated from how time zones
            are normally specified. For example, PDT is specified as -0800,
            but in the time zone string, will be specified as `PDT+08`.
            You can experiment with the string "%#c %Z %z" and the
            `--timezone` option to ensure you understand how these work
            together. If offset hours are omitted, they are assumed to be
            zero.

        [:mm]
            Minutes, prefixed with mandatory colon.

        [:ss]
            Seconds, prefixed with mandatory colon.

        [dzn]
            Three-letter daylight-saving-time zone such as PDT. If daylight
            saving time is never in effect in the locality, omit dzn. The C
            run-time library assumes the US rules for implementing the
            calculation of Daylight Saving Time (DST).

        Examples of the timezone string include the following:

            UTC       Universal Coordinated Time
            PST8      Pacific Standard Time
            PDT+07    Pacific Daylight Time
            NST+03:30 Newfoundland Standard Time
            PST8PDT   Pacific Standard Time, daylight savings in effect
            GST-1GDT  German Standard Time, daylight savings in effect

Delta Time Formatting
----------------------
    Time differences are reported using the delta time formats. The delta time
    format has the following syntax:

                               %_['kd][u[0]]<U>[.[#]]
                                  -v-  -v--  v  --v-
            Numeric Format --------'    |    |    |
            Next Greater Unit ----------'    |    |
            Units ---------------------------'    |
            Decimal Precision --------------------'

    Numeric Format ['kd] (_optional_)
        The optional `'` character is followed by two characters, k and d.
        k represents the character to use for the thousand's separator, with
        the special case that `0` indicates that there is to be no thousands
        separator. The d character is the character to use for the decimal
        point, if one is present. So, for example, `'0.` specifies no
        thousands separator, and the American `.` decimal point. `'.,` would
        specify European formatting, with `.` for the thousands separator, and
        `,` as the decimal point.

    Next Greater Unit [u[0]] (_optional_)
        This single lowercase letter indicates any preceding units used in the
        delta time printing. For example, if the unit is hours, and the next
        greater unit is years, then the hours reported are the remainder
        (modulo) after the number of years. Supported next greater units
        include the following:

            y - Nominal years (see units below for definition)
            t - Tropical years (see units below for definition)
            d - Days
            h - Hours
            m - Minutes

        If the next greater unit is followed by a zero, then the result is
        zero-padded to the appropriate width for the range of possible values.

    Units <U> (_required_)
        The unit of time (single uppercase letter) to report for the time
        delta. This is the remainder after the (optional) next greater unit.
        The following units are supported:

            Y - Nominal years
            T - Tropical years
            D - Days
            H - Hours
            M - Minutes
            S - Whole seconds

        Nominal years are 365 days in length.

        Tropical (or solar) years are approximately equal to one trip around
        the sun. These are useful to approximate the effect of leap years when
        reporting multi-year durations. For this program, a tropical year is
        defined as 365 + 97/400 days.

        The following are the supported combinations of next greater unit and
        unit:

            Y
            T
            D yD tD
            H yH tH dH
            M yM tM dM hM
            S yS tS dS hS mS

    Decimal Precision [.[#]] (_optional_)
        With the exception of seconds, all units will have a fractional value
        for time differences. If the decimal precision format is omitted, the
        then rounded whole value is printed.

        If the decimal point and number is specified, then the fractional
        value will be printed with the number of requested digits.

        If a decimal point is specified but without subsequent digits, then
        the number of digits will depend on the units. Enough digits will be
        printed to maintain full resolution of the unit to within one second.
        Thus, years: 8 digits, days: 5, hours: 4, minutes: 2.

    Examples
         Given a delta time of 547,991,463 seconds, the following delta format
         strings will yield the following output:

            %_S
                '547991463'

            %_',.S
                '547,991,463'

            %_Y years, %_yD days, %_dH. hours
                '17 years, 137 days, 11.8508 hours'

    See `--time examples` for more example uses of delta time formats.
